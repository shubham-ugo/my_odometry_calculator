# My Odometry Calculator - README

This repository contains a ROS package that listens to `geometry_msgs/Twist` data published by a node named `your_new_topic`. It calculates the odometry based on the twist velocities and publishes the odometry data to the `odom` topic.


## Usage
To use this odometry calculator package, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd my_odometry_calculator
   ```

3. Build the ROS package:

   ```bash
   catkin_make
   ```

4. Run the odometry calculator node:

   ```bash
   rosrun my_odometry_calculator odom_calculator_node
   ```

5. Ensure that the `your_new_topic` node is publishing `geometry_msgs/Twist` data.

6. Monitor the `odom` topic to observe the calculated odometry values.
